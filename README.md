This is a repository for **Pyology's VR application for Fetal Echocardiography Visualisation**.

The application was developed on Unity (Version 2022.3.14f1) using the Meta Quest 2 as the head-mounted device. The application displays a heart model generated from a series of meshes at different time-points of a cardiac cycle, and allows the user to interact with the model.

A demo video shows the current functionalities implemented:
